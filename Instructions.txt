Excel Parser, to check the frequency of words' appearance in a document or string, check it against a predetermined word ferequency list,
then return a pdf with the words in bold, and a graph of the word frequency.
- Keep the settings.txt file in the same folder as the excelparser.exe.
- Open the settings file and put in the absolute path of the document. The example, 
"C:\Users\my\Desktop\Excel Parser\Romeo And Juliet Chap 1 Page 1.txt" is already there, so replace 
that with that of the essay you want to use
- Also edit the absolute path of the Excel file, same as above.
- Follow the on-screen prompts. It generates a bar chart at each runtime, and saves it to the same directory as
the code.
- The pdf is generated only if you ask it to, and if you put in a value greater than 16 for the word difficulty
level, it just takes everything in category 17 and makes that bold.
- For the movie line script, it works in the same way, except that you direct the Essay File Path to the movie,
instead of a sample essay.
- Thank you for your business, I'm grateful for the chance and I hope you have a nice day :D
